Then it poses a question which is nearly impossible to answer. Does he deserve his freedom, or at least control over his mind? Can we change someone so fundamentally? And that ending, where Alex realizes he can fight the programming, is fittingly bleak. Kubrick believes that human nature is set. In another movie, that could be optimistic. In the disgusting future of *A Clockwork Orange* it's not.

Aside from the intensely realistic, and yet still phenomenally-stylized, violence, it is one of the most beautiful movies to watch as a purely visual experience. I'd put it just below 2001 in Kubrick's catalog and a hair above Dr. Strangelove, just judging it by its visual qualities. The hyper-stylized production design roots it solidly in the time it was made, but also makes it visually unique and gives a surreal quality that helps keep the violence and vileness of every single character from becoming overwhelming.\n",

      "Then you have the three different timelines, Nolan loves to integrate time as a theme in his movies, but here i don't see the added value, in fact i'd argue that a core aspect of it is largely unnoticeable until the very end, a gimmick rather than a meaningful addition and ultimately it creates a rather repetitive narrative.  \n",

Thus taking his place in any situations that could put the true Vader's life at risk?
