"That is not a movie I enjoy. It destroyed me emotionally. And yet, that is exactly what it is meant to do. Confront, and shock and present us with the worst part of humanity. Then it poses a question which is nearly impossible to answer. Does he deserve his freedom, or at least control over his mind? Can we change someone so fundamentally? And that ending, where Alex realizes he can fight the programming, is fittingly bleak. Kubrick believes that human nature is set. In another movie, that could be optimistic. In the disgusting future of *A Clockwork Orange* it's not. Honestly, this film is full of so much evocative imagery, it has a great lead performance, and it is real film making with some thought behind it, some serious questions. One of Kubrick's masterpieces.",-0.8057

"Phemonenal. Brilliant movie. One of the all-time great works of cinema. Aside from the intensely realistic, and yet still phenomenally-stylized, violence, it is one of the most beautiful movies to watch as a purely visual experience. I'd put it just below 2001 in Kubrick's catalog and a hair above Dr. Strangelove, just judging it by its visual qualities. The hyper-stylized production design roots it solidly in the time it was made, but also makes it visually unique and gives a surreal quality that helps keep the violence and vileness of every single character from becoming overwhelming.

The commentary track by Malcolm Mcdowell on the Blu-Ray (and the double-disc DVD set) is an amazing education into the making of a Kubrick film. It details things you recognize as well as highlighting things - like Kubrick's use of almost exclusively natural lighting throughout the film - that you might never have noticed. I think it would have been a solid contender for Best Cinematography if it hadn't gone up against Fiddler On The Roof, The Last Picture Show *and* The French Connection; I can't explain why it was shut out of the Best Art Direction/Set Decoration category.",0.9848

"I found this movie claustrophobic in a unique way. The entire city seems dangerous and paranoid, and it gets worse the deeper you get. Carlito only recognizes like 1/3 of the city's criminal element now, but just about everyone recognizes him. Almost every scene in the club gets unnervingly loud and the lack of definition on random passerby increases the sense of menace.

Also, for such a generic premise, it's almost shocking how consistently excellent the acting is. Pacino, Penn, Leguizamo, Miller, Guzman. Everything feels real, and every time someone leaves Carlito's presence, you feel anxiety that they're either getting into danger or planning to betray Carlito. Utterly rewatchable, even with TNT/TBS edits, whereas Scarface is a good beginning and a great end and like 2 scenes in between that are worth watching.",-0.7724

Trivia: The Laywer in 'GTA: Vice City' game (2002) is heavily based of Sean Penn character. Both worked as lawyers, helped the protagonists of their respective franchises, and were heavily addicted to cocaine and both did something that made the protagonist sever their ties with them (in Kleinfeld's case, he was going to testify against Carlito and Tommy severed his ties with Rosenberg because of his drug addiction).

"Movies based on a television series are always hard to get right...on the one hand you have to appeal to your fan base who love the show the movie is based off of, and on the other you have to make a comprehensible, enjoyable film  that people who have never seen a single episode of the show will enjoy.

That being said, I fail to see how this movie could have been any better. Killer action sequences, cutting edge animation throughout, a musical score that rivals the series in every way, and character developing banter that is rooted in the crews personalities created in the show (Jet is left out of the loop by the other characters and is bitter about it, Faye gets into trouble thinking she can handle an easy bounty on her own, Ed and Ein provide comic relief and offer a different perspective to central story events, and Spike is adamant about pretending he doesn't care about anything but making money from a job until pressed otherwise).

I love this movie, not as much as the series, but it serves as an excellent introduction to it to the uninitiated, and as a great fan service to the shows devoted following. 8/10, would recommend.  ",0.9866
Felt like a long episode that fit in somewhere near the end of the shows chronology. The show is amazing and I love it. The one thing I really disliked was the love interest.

"Nolan's work gets more and more frustrating to watch. While he has grand ideas and the budget to execute on them, his stories are less and less coherent and concise.
Now don't get me wrong, this is a good looking film, but even the presentation falters when you notice that the beach is rather empty, that there is no blood while bombs literally explode on people (i am not advocating for violence being a prime priority, but if you present something a certain way, you have to go through with it, especially in an anti war film).
Then you have the three different timelines, Nolan loves to integrate time as a theme in his movies, but here i don't see the added value, in fact i'd argue that a core aspect of it is largely unnoticeable until the very end, a gimmick rather than a meaningful addition and ultimately it creates a rather repetitive narrative.  
Another big flaw is that there are no characters to care for, and i understand that this is designed to be this way, but that doesn't mean it succeeds in doing so. One usually needs some interesting characters to care for the events taking place, there are exceptions but i didn't feel like dunkirk was one of them.  
To give some credit where its due, the film creates scenes and situations which are rather intense, one could argue it's not a film about war but rather survival. The score of hans zimmer does the majority of the work to make this happen.
So if you are interested in listening to a ticking clock for almost 2 hours, this is the film for you.",0.8716
I liked it a lot. Both my Grandads were on that beach trying to get back to England so maybe I’m being biased,0.1779
"It’s a great intense movie that tells a wonderful tale of survival and triumph against the odds. Only gripes I have with it is it’s too short for a Nolan film and the story structure he uses can be confusing and jarring when you first watch it.

It’s one of my favourite movies from 2017 & one I’ve gone back to a few times 😁",0.8834
"I essentially loved two thirds of Dunkirk and tolerated another third, the RAF sections were fantastic and likely the best WW2 dogfighting scenes of any movie. I’ve actually what that section on its own skipping through the other bits and it’s a great watch. The beach and action around the beach scenes are really well done, especially when merged with that ticking background music building tension; there was a real sense of frustration and inevitability about the whole situation (and the dive bombers were terrifying). 

The small boat scenes were, however, really frustrating, I have no idea why Nolan chose to manufacture a piece of drama (around George). It added nothing to the movie and in fact distracted from the plot; what the small boat was doing and its involvement in the story was fine, how it dovetailed with the other moments of the story. But the whole Cillian Murphy and George stuff was just narratively redundant and nearly ruined the movie for me.",0.6637
I thought that it was masterful film-making from a technical standpoint but I agree that the movie isn't very investing emotionally and I do think all war movies should be rated R. Definitely my least favorite Nolan movie but I can still enjoy it because of the craftsmanship.,0.3674

"Probably a top three Nolan film for me (after TDK and Interstellar). Loved the visuals, music, action, and sheer terror of it all. I get your criticism but I think it was intentional to have barely any character development. Because for the battle of Dunkirk, it's a bunch of faceless men just trying to survive. Their is no real story there other than that, survive. Which is why he made it more about the Dunkirk rescue itself then about a specific character and his journey. 

Hell, he named the lead character Tommy because British soldiers back then were called ""Tommy Boy's""",-0.8047

"Nolan wanted to make the movie without a script. Thomas, his wife and producing partner, told him no way. 

I think it shows. It's a directorial exhibit with no characters to root for and therefore I can't get behind it. It's a film that automatically deduces ""English soldiers = good guys"" and ""the other guys = bad guys"" but without showing this nuance in any way in the film. 

For me it was a well directed but shallow experience. I was underwhelmed and out of Nolan's work it's one I won't rewatch in favor of movies like The Dark Knight, Interstellar or The Prestige.",0.1313
"Dunkirk is my favourite Nolan film.  I've seen it probably 10 times.  It's weird how Nolan fans tend to be polarized about what his best work is.  It looks like a lot of people think Dunkirk is his worst and Interstellar is his best, while I feel the exact opposite.

I like every Nolan movie, but one thing I liked about Dunkirk is that it felt like he took a step forward as a filmmaker.  My sharpest criticism of pre-Dunkirk Nolan was his tendency toward exposition and in not trusting his audience much.  I think Dunkirk exceeds at telling a story visually, executed with technical proficiency, and it's really something you could only get in a movie. The character development, although admittedly slight, happens in moments of knowing glances and subtle gestures. I can totally see how fans of his earlier work would respond differently.

Further to the rating comment, I found it a breath of fresh air actually.  I remember watching Hacksaw Ridge (great movie, still) sometime soon after and the gory battle scenes struck me as a retread of what war films / shows have been doing since Saving Private Ryan.",-0.6471
"Dunkirk feels like the kind of movie that does everything just right, but doesn't excel at anything.

"I thought this movie was terrible.

I really don't understand how you could literally have the movie written for you by *actual history* and somehow make it more boring than a high-school lecture about the actual history.

The set-up for the necesity of the evacuation was barely mentioned. The German blitzkrieg advance causing the fall of the Netherlands and the surrender of Belgium is some of the best military maneuvering by the Germans in the whole war, excepting the baffling decision to hold back Panzer tanks at Arras, waiting for a British tank counterattack that never materialized.

The rear guard fighting of the Dutch before the capitulation of Belgium was heroic, trying to keep the pincers of three separate German columns from closing in on the beach at Dunkirk. Specifically, the actions of the Bristish 51st Highland Division. (They deserve their own movie. Nope, their own *franchise*...look them up.) Not mentioned beyond a few wide shots of the fighting continuing over the clifftops at dover.

These might have been a little more important to express the necessity of getting those troops out. If they had been captured, or engaged, the war couldv'e ended then and there. 

The numbers on the beach never really expressed how many people were actually there. When it was all said and done, 140k allied and almost 200 BEF troops were evacuated from the beach over 8 days. That's huge. There's a couple of shots of long lines of men to try to express this, and it fails horribly.

Nolan tries to capture the fear and confusion of being out of ammo, stuck on a beach, and getting strafed by luftwaffe on the regular. Terrifying. After giving us a couple of those shots, some blokes go after a tugboat. What? Okay. Except that story goes nowhere...just like all the troopers on the beach.

The evacuation was the largest callup of civilian ships in history. We get to experience this by one shot of a marina getting cleared out by Merchant Marines. In total there were 850 of the ""little ships"", private ships activated for the evacuation, that participated. We get the story of one, with an unnecessary death that does nothing to forward the story. 

One of the little ships ( The Sundowner) was privately owned, and captained during the evacuation (that wasn't common, most ships were commandeered) by none other than Charles Lightoller, former 2nd officer of the Titanic. No need to tell that story.

During the 8 days of evacuation, Germans sank 177 ships and shot down 200 aircraft. Meh. Let's not put any of that in the movie.

To be fair, I think it told the story accurately, I just think it could have been done so much better. More action, more depth, more background. Less people standing around.",-0.9423

If you think that the characters and their development is the most important thing, or at least close to it, then you probably won’t like it.

Here is my main issue with it. I get it. The main character is the event Dunkirk itself. But the one character I somewhat cared about falls and hits his head, goes blind and just dies. 

I do think how Christopher Nolan played with time in that movie was pretty cool. Visually and techincally, sure the movie is brilliant. But at the same time, the movie is a fucking slog to get through. It's like 1hr 45min or something like that and feels like 4 hours. And again, I need some character. 

This is what makes war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and even more recently like Fury and Lone Survivor (especially since you know how this movie in particular is gonna end from the real life story and beginning of the movie.) so good. In between the war battles and violence, you have the character and more quiet moments and get attached. I didn't get that with Dunkirk.

I wanted to love this movie so damn much. I love Christopher Nolan's movies and love war movies, so I thought this was match made perfection. But no. I saw this 3 times. Once in theaters and twice on HBO, and I felt the same way each time. *Meh*.

Also, I do not buy the ""It was a theater experience to apperciate!!!"" argument at all. So don't even pull that on me.

This is Nolan's worst and most overrated movie. Sorry, not sorry.",0.8916
"I agree with the rated R thing, he could do a whole lot more with it. I only saw it the once in theaters, but I really enjoyed it. The time thing and how the plotlines all merged was pretty cool to me and I thought a lot of the acting was great. Not Nolan's best by far, but definitely not his worst.",0.975
"It just worked on me. 
I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I realy feared for the character because the movie showed us many différent way they could have die. By the end when the ticking sound I felt all the tension drop 

I think the fact that the main characters don't get character is a good thing because in a way that put them at the same level than all the other soldier and they could die all the same.",-0.91
"Bizarrely at the cinema, I found it pretty cold and alienating, I couldn't engage with it and found it confusing and ineffective. But at home, with decent surround and watching with a friend, I really got into it and loved it. I think as usual with Nolan it relies heavily on Zimmer's score, which really ramps up the emotion more than the characters.",0.7823
"I think it’s a huge technical achievement. The sound mix, cinematography, and practical / visual effects are outstanding, but that’s about it for me.

I wanted to love this movie, but I walked away feeling it was HIGHLY overrated. I especially did not care for the odd editing and ordering choices. Typically I’m cool with that from Chris Nolan but it just didn’t land with me this time.

The story and characters were not enough in the theater to make me invested and the one time I’ve seen it (In IMAX) I spent most of the movie being wowed...but in more of a way of “I wonder how they shot that.” Which should not be what I’m thinking about.

And finally, Zimmers Score is an absolute bore outside of the film this time around.

In conclusion, an R rating would not have affected my enjoyment of the film in the slightest",0.8985

"*Rocky* is genuinely brilliant. It's a classic for a reason. I'm not even into boxing and I love it.

*Rocky II* isn't as smart as the first one, but it does feel like a natural extension of the characters and events of the first movie so I feel like it's a worthy sequel.

*Rocky III* starts getting more conventional, with the main conflict being straight-up good-versus-evil and seemingly lower stakes with a Rocky who'd now be secure and comfortable with or without boxing, and it also doesn't take the opportunity to draw some comparisons between Clubber Lang and the underdog Rocky from the first movie. But it's really fun to watch — more fun than the second movie — and I really liked how things resolved with Rocky and Apollo. If the series had ended here as a ""Rocky trilogy"" that would've been perfectly satisfying.

*Rocky IV* is a fucking cartoon. Superhero Rocky goes up against Evil Soviet Robot and defeats communism. Terrible movie — I don't even find it enjoyably bad. Maybe you have to be American to like it.

*Rocky V* is tricky because my opinion is kind of split: the way the Balboas get railroaded into becoming poor again at the beginning is absolutely terrible and justifiably hated, but once that's over and the actual plot can begin the movie becomes decent. It's the same problem that *Alien^3* has.

*Rocky Balboa* is probably the best sign-off the main Rocky series could have hoped for. Genuinely brilliant again.

*Creed* is also brilliant as a spin-off, with how it feels like a true continuation and at the same time definitely its own thing, with a new main character who is genuinely compelling in his own right while still giving the character of Rocky his due and treating him with respect.",0.9941

"Beautifully shot beautiful people with intimacy problems blamed on addiction using ambiguity to disguise a lack of deeper meaning. Great performances but obviously a 70 page script stretched threadbare to hit an 80 minute runtime with lots of lingering silences, long takes, actual full-on musical performances sung at half speed, a three minute jog through the city in single, and honest-to-god slow motion.

Then, if you think too hard about it, the third act completely collapses in on itself and the conclusion in no way follows the premise, not to mention some straight-up backwater homophobic cautionary shit straight out of a De Palma or Noe film with a movie-of-the-week attempted suicide slapped on to the end for insta-gravity (just add the water from your tears).

The movie is SERIOUSLY flawed to the point of absurdity when it moves beyond its simple dialogue scenes, but since McQueen and Fassbender did Hunger (a vastly superior exercise) together it got a lot of leeway.

Honestly, even arthouse critics like to watch fucking onscreen, they just really hate people pointing it out. To that extent, it is a visceral experience at points that transcends your better dramas (because of the fucking).",-0.9221
"For me, the movie was great because of how desperate Fassbender's character was, how little disregard he had for everything in his life for that release he craved constantly. That kind of desperation is rarely seen in movies. That's what sticks in my mind, Fassbender being great along with the super subtle performance Carey Mulligan gives.",0.7717
"To answer your question, yes you did miss something.  If you think it's about a man who is a pervert and is just fucking people, you're wrong.  

The film is first and foremost an examination of sex addiction.  Michael Fassbender's character gets no joy from what he's doing, it's mechanical.  What's worse is that is has ruined his ability to connect with others; sure he can pick up women but he can't love and it ruins his relationship with his coworker.  As the title suggests, he hates himself for this problem he has, but he can't do anything about it.

It's a beautiful film, which isn't a surprise because it's Steve McQueen.  His previous film, *Hunger* is near-perfect and obviously *12 Years a Slave* is also a phenomenal film as well.  If you ever want to really understand the film, pay attention to the way it's shot; the cinematography does a lot of telling in this film.",-0.9273

"I love origin movies because sometimes they can so neatly fit into the Freytag's pyramid of story progression: introduction, inciting moment, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. But then they cut out just before the denouement, which leads naturally into a cliffhanger for what is implied to be their next big adventure. Casino Royale is a perfect example of this and the way it ends right on the ""Bond, James Bond."" Ditto with Iron Man's ""I am Iron Man.""

The problem is when origin stories don't fit into this format or when they have to make significant compromises to the pacing to fit this format. The JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot is an example of this. They had to **massively** compress the timeline in order to end Kirk we think he should be at, i.e. as captain of the *Enterprise*. The movie still works as an action movie, but the plot holes are conspicuous and glaring, and the audience becomes fully aware that this is just a contrived movie and not an honest telling of the character's actual origin story.

That latter sort of movie is the kind of origin stories that I think people generally don't like because they don't fit organically into the narrative of a character.

The former type of origin story, however, I think works very well and sometimes unintentionally left out of discussions of the flaws of origin stories because they fit so well into the character's arc, but they are also quite formulaic and can lead to fatigue if repeatedly depended on.",0.9402

"I'm loving the revision/backlash that has continued building with this film. Particularly now that most people realise its clearly a remake of ANH. Disney weren't taking any chances with kicking off its multi-billion dollar, multi-picture Star Wars investment and told the film-makers: remake the classic as a no-brainer slam dunk cash in.

Problem was they did a shit job with TFA. Particularly Mary-Sueing Rey who already has no where to go with her story arc being so powerful already - able to fight off a Sith with zero training and fly the MF like an expert acrobatic flyer. Just idiotic in the extreme.

I hardly hear anyone say anything positive about TFA except young kids (incl those on reddit who like its shiny, glossy JJ look). And that because its not a good film. Its sums up hollywood these days - over the top, shiny, poorly structured crap uses colour and movement to keep the kids occupied for 88 minutes. 

It was a such a cowardly movie when they had this incredibly universe full of mythology and fun tropes to use and they just redid an older film. Utterly gutless. ",-0.3504

I was also disappointed in how instead of creating new iconic starfighters, they just brought back the ones we already got in the original trilogy.

"I think it's fundamentally a good film, but the overbearing reliance on nostalgia does hurt it, and will continue to hurt it in the long run as people look back on it.

The common argument is that TFA ""had"" to be a nostalgia-driven film in order to win people back after the prequels. Even if you agree with that premise (I don't), it's going to become increasingly irrelevant as the years go on. By the time we get to the next decade, we'll be in an era where Star Wars is indisputably thriving and growing and experimenting, and at that point TFA's nostalgia is just going to seem like an oddity. 

I really don't think TFA ""had"" to be anything other than *good* in order to successfully relaunch Star Wars. There was already enough inherent nostalgia value by virtue of being a sequel to Return of the Jedi, with the returning cast and such. The thing that kills me is that the fundamental things the movie *actually* needed to be a success are all there- good characters, great action, emotion and fun. Those things are the reason the movie was a hit- not because of Starkiller Base, or the superconservative artistic design. Those things were overkill, and they prevent the movie from being the genuine, indisputable classic that I believe it could have been. ",0.9581

"To be honest, I thought it was a bad movie and the prequels were better. There's just so much not to like about it: 


1- The entire story is a rehash of a New Hope. 


2-There were no memorable action scenes or duels (at least TPM had duel of the fates). 


3-There was little to no originality with the settings and planets (Jakku is basically Tatooine and Starkiller base was Hoth and the death star rolled together). 


4- A third death star, really?!! 


5-The villains are mostly boring and unoriginal. Phasma did nothing apart from stand around in shiny armour, Hux is a generic space nazi villain and the First order just recycles stormtroopers. At least the prequel trilogy had the droid army which was a cool and original idea. Kylo Ren is alright and has potential to a great conflicted villain in the next two films. Only problem with him is that I feel that he should have defeated Rey. 


6- Rey is a boring protagonist in the respect that she is too perfect and can do ANYTHING.  As a result of this, she has no flaws and is therefore hard to root for or feel sympathy for. Her story is basically the same as Luke's so that doesn't help. 


7- Apart from Han, the returning characters didn't really add anything to the story. 


8- Finn had potential to great character with his original backstory but he spent a lot of the time looking like a fool and didn't really evolve throughout the film. 


9- This is subjective but I'm not a fan of the humour. 


10- It didn't feel like a star wars movie. The pacing was way too quick with characters rushing off to the next location, the marvel humour felt out of place and it strangely didn't feel alien/spacey enough. At least the prequels gave you the feeling that you were in a galaxy with the politics, the many new alien species and the different planets. TFA didn't add anything new and just stuck to basics while sprinkling some humour in.

"It's pretty good. I hope episode 8 and 9 are much better though. Most of the problems with it come from bad writing. 


Death Star 3 was dumb. 


Poe is hardly a character, what character he has is badly written turn it up to 11 trash and should have died. 


There are too many instances of characters like Poe and Leia caring about people they never met and only heard mentioned in conversation a few minutes prior. This causes the third act to make no sense emotionally. 


The movie needed Luke Skywalker. They figured good reasons to not have him,  but not how to make it a good story. 


The writers didn't get a lot of what made Star Wars good.  Namely they didn't understand that the space battles needed to feel more realistic by not actually being realistic. 


The pilots calling each other by first names was weirdly dumb. 


To give Finn an arc, they nerfed him but everyone else is OP. WTF? 


Mystery box bull shit is mystery box bullshit JJ.


Stylistically the director etc seemed to not understand how to make a star wars movies. Star Wars is always a genre mashup, but they approached it as if it's a genre itself. The OT is cowboys, samurai, wizards, and pirates in space fighting Nazis lead by a black night. TFA did less than half of that. 


The ship designs sucked, they updated a few ships,  but they didn't do anything creative with them nor did they create anything new. Even the prequels came up with new interesting designs. 


It lacked in weird shit too. It just didn't have enough wierd shit.


No lando no dice.


No one lost an arm. Big fuck up there. 


Big missed opportunity when Han died,  they shoulda had they people say no!!! Then Chewie gives a deafening roar and proceedes to charge a squad of storm troopers,  tears them limb from limb,  hesitates killing kylo, kylo lops his arm off, Chewie falls, you think he's dead,  but the rest of the movie plays out the same. He coulda given kylo a good claw swipe to the face. Make cool scars.


It also robs a bit of the magic from the OT.


In the end it's better than 3 of the films for sure,  it's not better than any of the OT, it's maybe better than the revenge of the Sith.

Episode 7 had to be that way to bring all casual Star Wars and other film fans back into Star Wars.

The Force Awakens had to be a welcome back and now that everyone is back The Last Jedi can take us into new territory. ,0.6486
"Its wonderful. 

And its not just a rehash of episode 4. It takes familiar beats from the entire OT. The climax of the film for example, is much more like that of ROTJ than it is ANH.  

And while I'm sure this was done largely due to the studio wanting to ease our fears of a new prequel trilogy and give use something familiar to the universally liked part of the franchise.. 

The familiar beats do work as a meta extension of one of the film's major themes. The thematic crux of the film involves the weight of yearning for and trying to reclaim the past. (A potent theme, I think, for a long awaited new entry in a 40 year old franchise)

Rey is latched on to the idea that her family will return for her on Jakku. 
Kylo is obsessed with Vader and living up to Vader's legacy. 
The New Order is trying to reclaim the status of the fallen empire. 
The resistance is focused on finding Luke and returning a relic of his past (his lightsaber) 

and in their search for the past..
Kylo does what Vader could not, and kills his family. I think, removing his potential for redemption (but we'll see about that)
Rey finds a new family in adventuring away from Jakku. (perhaps even her real family, though I hope not.) 
We find Luke in a lonely state where he may not be the salvation we hoped, etc. 

So I think its neat that they extend this motif to the audience, by giving us something largely reminiscent of the OT, but ultimately different.

I really agree with this and I think is what made me not like the movie as much. I just don’t really see a need for the series to had been continued after *Part II,* and this was disappointing. I thought they utilized Michael incorrectly in some if not most parts and turned his character into something he wasn’t by the end of *II*, but I can at least see what they were going for.

It ends with him all alone, then flashes back to the Christmas dinner with everyone at the table. When Don Vito comes home, everyone jumps in excitement and rushes to greet him, except for Michael. Michael sits there, alone, as the rest of the family lauds his father with ""He's a Jolly Good Fellow"".

The dialogue, at times, was also atrocious. Does nobody remember ""he's your first cousin!"" ""then I'll love him first!"" You can't blame her on that one, delivery aside.

Godfather Part 3 was a total blank check of a movie that really needed some intervention somewhere along the line. 

The reality is that Part 3 is largely FFC writing his love letter to opera, in order to make a near-final chapter* to the series. The characters have started to drift into pantomime, the scenery and scope have exploded into beautiful and convoluted ways, even the deaths at the end look like ""stage"" deaths.

I enjoy it for that. I enjoy it, because it's done well in that vein. It doesn't feel like the previous chapters, because honestly--it's its own thing.

Some people hate the wedding scene at the beginning of the first, but I love it. Some people hate 3 for being weird, but I accept it. Some people say 2 was the best, I think I still prefer 1. I'm always on the fence about that.

Also, Michael is diabetic and under a lot of stress, so his blood sugars are probably all over the place which will mess with your emotions, too.

"I love the movie. It has one of the best sword fights in it. The characters are all very well played and portrayed and the story matches very well to the book.
I enjoy the story within a story and how you can watch the day pass as the grandfather is reading the book to his grandkid. 
I love how in the end, it reflects character growth from the beginning of the movie (the kid hated kissing, but in the end was ok with it because it was a great ending to the story)
I adore how it's a story about love and how the world comes together to help you achieve your dream with those you love, and to never give up hope. Even when you're a drunkard who is looking to seek revenge for his father's death. Or kidnapped by pirates to search for your beloved, or even the princess who stood up against the world when it told her her love was dead.
The movie is riddled with unexpected comedy (ROUS) and beautiful choreography.
Not mentioning all the wonderful behind the scenes bits that make the stories more touching. ",0.9942

"Having not seen it as a child, I lack the nostalgia-glasses I feel most people have. Personally, I don't particularly enjoy it except for a few moments here and there. I'd give it 6/10 at most.

But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. If it is a fine movie to have nostalgia for, plenty of quotables and whatnot. I don't mind that people like it so much. I too have rose colored nostalgia glasses for many films that in general might be considered ""bad"" from a more objective point of view.",0.2512

Great movie! My all time favorite! Val Kilmer is amazing as Doc Holliday I consider his performance to be up there with Heath ledgers Joker ,0.9183
Val Kilmer's best performance in my opinion. ,0.6369
">  I don't know why this western is not considered more valued.

It isn't more valued because outside of Kilmer as Doc Holiday it is completely forgettable. The first half of Tombstome plays like a well funded TV Western that is doing its best to parody Ford Westerns. Kilmer as Holiday did have a number of great moments as comic relief. 

The movie does the shoot out at the OK Coral and then it just becomes a montage of the nameless good guys killing nameless bad guys. ",0.9184

"I am not sure *exactly* how they would pull this off. One of the few plot twists that come to mine could be that Anakin had been cloned sometime during Attack of the Clones, and had been trained under Vader's rule as an apprentice? Thus taking his place in any situations that could put the true Vader's life at risk? Then an explanation for the spirits at the end is they could all be figments of Luke's imagination, because he truly believes his father has perished.",-0.2076
"I think it's a bad idea.  That being said, I always wondered why the Emperor wouldn't try cloning Anakin.  I know expanded universe rules say cloned jedi go crazy, but that wasn't stated in the films so it isn't truly canon.  A cloned Anakin would have his full force potential and could be raised and indoctrinated from birth.  Perhaps the Emperor was actually satisfied with a less powerful Vader as he would be less of a threat.",-0.6459
"It's not my favorite Lynch movie, but it's probably my favorite Nic Cage performance. The final scene with him singing ""Love Me Tender"" is brilliantly, unashamedly cheesy and it makes me unreasonably happy.",0.937
"Its 50s pulp noir wrapped up in Lynch’s classic “evil just beneath the veneer of normal” with a healthy dose of Wizard of Oz sprinkled on top. 

An array of eccentric characters, as you expect from Lynch, all intertwined in a pretty straightforward plot of narcissism, control and murder. 

It’s one of my three favorite  Nic Cage performances that keeps me from writing him off completely.  The other two being Raising Arizona and Adaptation. 

It has so many memorable moments (Death of Bobby Ray Lemon, Crash in the desert, bank robbery, dancing at the club, find me some music on this radio this instant, killing Johnny, Bobby Peru propositions Lula, making a pornographic movie Texas style, etc) and nearly every character is a standout.

The book is very straightforward but an interesting read for anyone who wants a little more background and character moments.

This actually helps to unpack the themes better and I consider the film to be vastly superior to the source material. ,0.9481
